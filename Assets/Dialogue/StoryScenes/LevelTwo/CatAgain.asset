      were living animals. Animals I guess I knew somehow. And I know that cat eats
      rats so\u2026 "

      you felt the difference between now and in the lab. Maybe it had something
      to do with what was happening in this place.] "

      examiners always end up in this elevator to the outside world supposedly. '
